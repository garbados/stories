title: Death, Coffin-Maker
summary: The shepherd of the dead meets his successor.

*Pound, pound, pound in the nails. What are you building, craftsman? Coffins, sirrah. I am Death, the Coffin-Maker. Do you need a coffin? No, no. I don’t see an order for you yet. Pound, pound, pound; someone’s always got an order in, but not yet for you, no. Whose coffin is this, Death? Jeremiah Macalaster. Killed by a knife in the night. His brother sent me the order. Something about stealing a woman. I imagine someone will soon be sending me an order for him too. Pound, pound, pound; someone’s always got an order. Someone always needs a coffin.*

Death is an ancient boy, long-limbed and hollow-eyed. He builds coffins without passion or emotion, only diligence, only attention. It is his distraction, some say. He'll never tell.

He builds Jeremiah's coffin and brings it to the village for his funeral, but when he arrives, there's no body. All the town is there, but there's no body. They can't find it.

“This is unacceptable,” Death grumbles. “There can't be a coffin without a body.”

He goes off in search of it. He talks to the townsfolk, hunts every home, and can't find it. But he does find Jeremiah's widow. She's in mourning, of course. She can hardly muster words without issuing tears, but Death sees fire behind the sadness. Determination.

"You're hiding the body," he says, "Where is he?"

"I'm not hiding anything."

"He's gone. You can't bring him back. Where is he?"

She bites her lips and shakes her head before the sobs come again.

Death, having exhausted his resources in town, carries his coffin and goes hunting in the fields. He recalls from a distant memory another place one might hide a body, a ramshackle house the forest reclaimed eons ago. He trundles off to it, and sees light through its broken front window. Hearing whispers, he peeks in, and sees the widow.

And the body.

She's reading from a book... Death knows it from somewhere.

Death hears a muffled cry, and sees in the corner, bound and gagged, Jeremiah's brother, his killer. Death remembers now what this means.

It should be noted, Death can detect the dead. He can hear them, talk with them, and know them as he knew them in life. But he is bound to bury them.

There is a way to know the dead again, as Death realizes the widow is trying to do. One can trade a soul for another -- that's the way he learned the ritual, anyway. So the widow draws a knife over her captive's throat, and spills the steaming blood into a bowl of herbs and totems. But there's a trick to knowing the dead, which she'll soon find, as she pours the elixir in her lover's mouth and chants the invocation.

Death remembers now, the book she was reading. It was his journal, before he was Death. He loved a woman, taken by plague. So he traded the cleric that failed to heal her’s life for a chance to know her again.

The widow issues a blood-curdling scream as her eyes blacken and her limbs grow long, as Death feels himself grow light.

She will know her love again, and so in that sense she has what she wanted.

She will speak with him again.

She will know his touch once more.

And then she will lay him in the ground.

And all to follow after him.
