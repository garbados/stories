title: Let Me In
summary: Anxiety -- or something worse.

“Let me in,” you hear. “I’m so hungry.”

You look around, but see nobody in the room.

“You are fat with fear,” it whispers. “Let me in.”

More frantically, your eyes dart from shadow to shadow.

“I watch your nightmares. I see you twitch and grimace in your sleep. I want it. Let me in.”

You look at the window, but only shadows greet you. The streetlamp casts your lawn in a sickly orange, but no one is there.

“I see your fears. The strangers who make you tense. The ideas you refuse to consider. The thoughts you don’t let yourself think. Your resistance is delectable.”

The closet, too, is empty. You route around in the racks, the boxes, more hurriedly now, as the whisper gains bass.

“When you sleep, I fantasize of sinking my teeth into your trembling dreamscape. I will drink your fears like nectar.”

Maybe it’s a virus? Or an ad? You shut windows, close tabs, but

“You bulge with terror, sweet suckling. Let me in that I might feast.”

You close the computer and back away. Your eyes jerk about, hunting the growing darkness for your intruder.

“Your every hope, too, holds fear. It is the greatest delicacy. Desire, suckling, is fear of loss.”

The lights on your power strip glow like eyes. The shadows deepen, and the eyes blink. You bolt for the door.

“Fear of absence. Fear of failure. I love the taste, sweet. Let me taste it.”

You slam it behind you and fumble in the darkness for the hall lamp, but it only whimpers light.

“Lesser specters threaten the body,” you hear from behind you, “But precious, I want you for your mind.”

You spin around and see a form phasing through the wall, misty ink-black nothing. “Let me in.”

You rush down the stairs to the front door, but before it, two white-hot holes peer back at you.

“Behind every want is another nightmare, suckling. Behind every dream,” the mist whirls about your ankles, “I am waiting.”

Your breath comes quick as your muscles lock up. The mist crawls up your skin, climbing your torso like a thousand spiders.

“You wanted out,” it whispers, the mist tickling your throat as it approaches your lips, “Now, I’m in.”

As you hear, “Let us feast,” you taste horror.
